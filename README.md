# Simple Grid View
A grid view (the kind of symmetrical grid you'd use for a pathfinding application or a game of some sort) based around UIKit. I am currently working on a visual pathfinder in Swift with this as a base, separate from any sort of pathfinding AI.

TO DO

- make a version to work specifically with Sprite Kit for non-UIKit games (like a top-down strategy game or role-playing game that would need a layer like this).
